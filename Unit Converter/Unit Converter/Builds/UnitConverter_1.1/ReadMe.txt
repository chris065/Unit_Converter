-----> This is version 1.1, so this is not the finished product, and not all of the features are present as these will come in
feature updates. Just to let you know.

-----> UPDATE NOTES:
------->When you are selecting the Unit to convert from (i.e. KM, M or CM) you can now just press, for example, "a" rather than having to type capital A.
------->Now inlcudes Temp Conversion.
